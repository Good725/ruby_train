Basics

Everyone knows ["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program), right?

Well, in case you don't remember, the way to do it in Ruby is:
```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
```

There are also a few ways to declare and assign ~~variables~~. If you want to declare a string (i.e. a sequence of text), you can do it like this:
```ruby
variable_name = "programming"
```

If you want to declare a number, do it like so:
```ruby
book_count = 5
gpa = 3.7
```

You probably know all this already, so we can jump ahead.
