```ruby
name1 = "Joffrey Baratheon"
name2 = "Arya Stark"
name3 = "Beric Dondarrion"
name4 = "Melisandre"
```

The characters in *Game of Thrones* are quite memorable, but memorizing their names can be difficult. The exercise in this unit is to find the average length of the names shown above and store it in a variable, **avg_length**. After that, you should declare a variable, **my_name**, and assign it the value that a user types into the console. Lastly, you should use an if-else block to compare the length of **my_name** to **avg_length** and print "<my_name> is shorter than average" when it is shorter, and "<my_name> is longer than average" otherwise.
