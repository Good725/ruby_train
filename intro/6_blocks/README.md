#Blocks#

If you have a good understanding of functions, **blocks** should be easy to pick up as well. In fact, it's easiest to think of blocks as nameless functions. Let's take a look.

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each do |i|           # Block start
    puts i
end                             # Block end

[4, 5, 6].each { |i| puts "Hi" * i }   # This is also a block
```

As you can see, the ```each``` method expects a block as an argument. This can be invoked with the keywords ```do``` and ```end```, or by using braces (```{}```).
